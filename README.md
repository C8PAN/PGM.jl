# OpenPP

*OpenPP* is an open source probabilistic programming framework in Julia.

The goal of this project is to join the efforts of the Julia community to develop a probabilistic programming framework.

We are still in the stage of drafting the specification. Here is the [current proposal](http://openpp-proposal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
